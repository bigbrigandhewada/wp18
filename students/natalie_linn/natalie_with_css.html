<p>Hey! I'm a junior illustration student. I like to sleep, bake pancakes, and draw cats.

<h2>Countries/Cities Visited</h2>
<p>My mom brought me to Mexico for a couple days when I was two, but other than that I've never left the U.S.

<p>I was born in San Francisco, spent most of my childhood in Santa Fe, then moved to Montana.</p><p>I lived in Missoula until RISD stole my corporeal form and rematerialized me in Providence.</p>

<p>Rhode Island is very flat. Y'all need more mountains.</p>
